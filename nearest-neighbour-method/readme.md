# [Machine Learning] Nearest Neighbor Method

The Nearest Neighbor Mehtod programmes in Python. Provided is a dataset of handwritten digits.
Every digit is a 32x32 bitmap.

The digits in digits.txt are following:

- First 50 entries are the digit 0
- Next 50 entries are the digit 1
- Last 50 entries are the digit 8

Task is to find a distance measure, that take a low as possible error rate.

With hamming distance, you get an error rate near 2%. I've got 3 errors in a dataset of 150.
